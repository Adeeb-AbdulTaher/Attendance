# Attendance
python script to take attendance in Google Meet


First made the script when a lecturer asked me to take the attandance for each class on Google Meet where the students typed in their roll numbers in the chat box.
This was made for my convinience therefore is limited to my institute where the student ID used to attend the class contains student's roll numbers.
The complete chat are to be copied and pasted into the terminal as input where the script is running.

How the script exactly works is given as comments in the python file.
The [first draft](https://github.com/Adeeb-AbdulTaher/Attendance/blob/main/Attendance%20IT-A.py) was only for my class, but the [Generalized version](https://github.com/Adeeb-AbdulTaher/Attendance/blob/main/Attendance%20Generalized.py) was useful for the complete College.
